Explore writing python web apps, including REST API

## Purpose
Let's explore
* simple python web app
* exploring Separation of Concersn, MVC (model-view-controller)
* writing a python REST API
* how does a python REST API look under the covers compared to a Node.js REST API
* we will assume the examples here will work in python 2.7.x as well as 3.x

Note: we will be using the django framework, and then the django rest framework, but
other python frameworks could be used, e.g. flask

## Conclusion
* Last tag: v5.05
* Moved development to [https://github.com/johnedstone/django-rest-api-openshift-s3-bucket](https://github.com/johnedstone/django-rest-api-openshift-s3-bucket)
