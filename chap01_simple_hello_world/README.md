### Getting started

Set up your env as below then run this hello world example. Feel free to clone this repo, branch, etc.

```
# Example setting up virtualenv and writing requirements
cd class102
virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/class102
source ~/.virtualenvs/class102/bin/activate

export PIP_PROXY=<ip:port>
pip install --proxy ${PIP_PROXY} pip --upgrade
pip install --proxy ${PIP_PROXY} django
echo "# python2.7" > requirements.txt
pip freeze | egrep -i django | tee -a requirements.txt

pip install --proxy ${PIP_PROXY} gunicorn
pip freeze |egrep gunicorn | tee -a requirements.txt

cd chap01_simple_hello_world
gunicorn hello -b 0.0.0.0:8888 --access-logfile -
# or simply
# gunicorn hello -b 0.0.0.0:8888

# Now view this at <your fqdn:8888>

```

#### Homework
* For your Homework: Add a new URL pattern and a function to display new content
* Hint: I've done Boo Hoo!
* For Extra Credit: Add a new URL pattern that returns 'Hello World', so that you have 2 urls returning the same content.
* Reminder:
    * talk about MVC, e.g. one can change the URL and get the same content
    * talk about trailing slash (301)

#### Comments
* This first example is [stolen shameless from ... ](https://github.com/lightweightdjango/examples/blob/chapter-1/hello.py)
which is an awsome book, though now somewhat outdated
* You can see that the django library is handling the requests and responses, e.g.
in `hello.py` the return is simple `HttpResponse`
* If you want to see a pure python, handling requests, headers, etc. see the first 
example here: [Pure Python](http://dfpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter_01.html)
* `gunicorn` is an often used python webserver,  used frequently together with Nginx or Openshift, or ..
* `gunicorn` [will look for a WSGI callable named application if not specified.](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/run.html)
 so one could have written `gunicorn hello:application -b 0.0.0.0:8888`
* Someday talk about the django toolbar
